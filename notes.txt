CRUD OPERATIONS OCCUR WITHIN THE DATABASE

BASIC REVIEW - 

NPM INIT - packages inside our applications - entry point glues the app together

NPM I EXPRESS PG CORS
Express - server in node js
Cors - different domain apps to interact with each other (different local hosts)
Pg connects db with server - enables the Pool command

In index for server, instantiate express, set up a listener, run the server and check the console
**Npm install nodemon globally - watch a single file, and every time there is a change the file will restart

Middleware requires app.use
Fullstack app requires data from client, which means data from request.body object: this glorious line:   app.use(express.json())

RESTFUL API - POSGRES
